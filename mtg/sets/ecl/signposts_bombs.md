# Lorwyn Eclipsed (ECL) Archetype Signposts and Bombs

## Archetype Signposts
Lorwyn Eclipsed features **five primary typal archetypes** (one per color pair from original Lorwyn block), each supported by gold signpost uncommons. These push tribal synergies with tribes like Merfolk, Goblins, Kithkin, Elementals, and Elves. Secondary archetypes exist around mechanics like Blight, Vivid, Flash/Faeries, but prioritize the primaries in Sealed.
