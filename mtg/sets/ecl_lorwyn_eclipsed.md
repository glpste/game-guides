# Lorwyn Eclipsed (ECL) Limited 
## Archetypes Ranking

Rankings for **Sealed** (primary focus) are derived from expert guides and early data (prerelease/early access as of Jan 16, 2026). **Primary typal archetypes** (2-color, tribe-focused with signpost uncommons) dominate due to easy assembly in pools and strong synergies. **Secondary mechanic-based** archetypes are splashable supports but harder to force and lower-powered.

**Draft notes**: Early Untapped.gg data (2,600 matches) shows UB Dimir (Tier B, 5.0% 6+ win rate), RW Boros (Tier B), with primaries like BG Golgari (high pop, Tier D) playable but lower conversion. 4-Color tops but rare. Data volatile—favor primaries in Sealed/Draft.

## Tier List (Sealed Priority: Strongest to Weakest)

| Tier | Archetype | Colors | Playstyle | Key Strengths | Winrate/Pop Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Tier 1A** | Kithkin | GW (Selesnya) | Go-Wide Aggro | Token swarms, ETB buffs (Thoughtweft Lieutenant), resilient to wipes; scariest early game. | Top implied; consistent pools.  |
| **Tier 1A** | Merfolk | WU (Azorius) | Tempo/Tap Value | Tapping for disruption/convoke (Wanderwine Distracter); evasive, wide boards. | #1 early power rank; strong commons.  |
| **Tier 1B** | Elves | BG (Golgari) | Graveyard Midrange | Self-mill/recursion (Scarblade Scout); grindy value, proliferate blight. | High pop (16.4% draft); solid payoffs.  |
| **Tier 1B** | Elementals | UR (Izzet) | Big Spells Midrange | 4+ CMC triggers doubled (Flamebraider); ETB chains, vivid enablers. | Highest ceiling (Risen Reef splashable); UR strong color.  |
| **Tier 1B** | Goblins | BR (Rakdos) | Sac/Death Midrange | Blight self-sac for triggers (Mudbutton Cursetosser); tokens, pings. | Explosive but grindier; high potential.  |
| **Tier 2** | Faeries/Flash | UB (Dimir) | Tempo/Disruption | Flash rewards, flyers (Bitterbloom Bearer); opponent's turn value. | Draft Tier B (5.0% 6+); splash into primaries.  |
| **Tier 2** | Vivid Ramp | GU (Simic) / RG (Gruul) | Ramp/Midrange | Multicolor triggers/fixing (Glister Bairn); splash enabler. | Reliable 5c goodstuff base; GU > RG.  |
| **Tier 2** | Blight Value/Aggro | WB (Orzhov) / RW (Boros) | Midrange/Aggro | -1/-1 counter manipulation (Reaping Willow); growth/timers. | Draft Tier B RW; flexible but narrow.  |

## Key Insights
- **Sealed Strategy**: Force primaries around bombs/signposts; splash 3rd color with vivid/fixing (12+ sources). 23-24 lands, 15+ creatures, 6-8 removal. Aggro/tempo > midrange in mirrors.
- **Color Pairs**: Blue/Red > White/Blue/Green/Black strongest; avoid mono/3+ without fixing.
- **Data Caveat**: Early (low sample); track 17Lands/Untapped for updates. Primaries 55-60% winrate expected in tuned pools.  


## Archetype Signposts and Bombs

### Archetype Signposts
