## Organizing Your Pulls
Efficient sorting reveals your best deck quickly (90 cards total).

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. Rares/Mythics | Pull aside all rares/mythics first; evaluate bombs. |
| 2. By Color | Sort commons/uncommons: White → Blue → Black → Red → Green → Multicolor → Colorless/Artifacts. Stack unplayables aside. |
| 3. Within Color | Sub-sort: Creatures → Spells/Removal → Lands/Fixing, then by CMC (1-drops to top end). |
| 4. BREAD Filter | **B**ombs (high-impact rares), **R**emoval, **E**vasion/Aggro, **A**bility cards, **D**uds (cut these). |

## Deckbuilding Tips and Tricks
- **Build Around Bombs**: Identify 1-2 top rares/mythics; force colors that support them + removal.
- **Color Discipline**: 2 main colors (deep 14-16 cards each); splash 3rd only with 2+ fixing + low-CMC off-color bomb/removal.
- **Mana Curve**: 14-16 1-2 drops, 6-8 3-4 drops, 3-5 5+ drops. 22-24 lands (24+ if curvy/slow).
- **Creature Count**: 14-17 creatures minimum.
- **Interaction**: 6-8 removal/tricks; prioritize versatile answers.
- **Have a Plan**: Aggro (low curve), Midrange (value creatures), Control (removal + finishers). Cut high-end for consistency in weak pools.
- **Synergies**: Check subtle links (e.g., deathtouch enablers).
- **Test Curves**: Goldfish 3-5 hands; adjust lands if flooding/screwing.

## Things to Look Out For
- **Bombs**: Game-changers (e.g., board wipes, evasion finishers, value engines). Play even if off-color with fixing.
- **Fixing**: Tri-lands, checklands, gainlands for splashes; count sources per color (16+ for main, 12+ for splash).
- **Removal Premium**: Top after bombs; answers win mirror matches.
- **Set Synergies**: Tribal, mechanics (e.g., vehicles need pilots).
- **High-Impact Commons**: Playable fillers like efficient 2-drops.
- **Grindy Format**: Expect longer games; favor card advantage/draw.

## Common Mistakes and Things to Avoid
| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Too Many Colors** | Stick to 2-2.5; greedy mana = dead hands. |
| **Poor Land Count** | Don't underman; calc: (curve avg × 40 / 17) +1 lands. |
| **Filler Cards** | Cut to exactly 40; no "maybes"—play best only. |
| **Top-Heavy Curve** | Balance 2-3 drops; avoid 5+ drop piles. |
| **No Removal** | Always 6+; bombs without answers lose. |
| **Weak Sideboard** | Plan swaps: anti-aggro, anti-fliers, grindy tools. |
| **Ignoring Context** | Weak pool? Go aggro. Strong? Grind/control. |

## General Tips and Tricks
- **Mulligan**: Keep hands with 2-3 lands + 2-drop. Mull to 6 aggressively in Bo1/Bo3.
- **Play/Draw**: Draw first default (access bombs); play first for fast decks.
- **Sideboarding**:
  | Matchup | In | Out |
  |---------|----|-----|
  | Aggro | Lifegain, blockers, sweepers | Slow bombs, card draw |
  | Control | Threats, disruption | Narrow removal |
  | Mirrors | More bombs/removal | Mediocre fillers |
- **Bo3 Focus**: Game 1 data informs sides; swap 4-8 cards.
- **Pool Registration**: If required, sort accurately under watch.
- **Time Management**: Build fast; prioritize goldfishing over perfection.

# BREAD Strategy in MTG Sealed

**BREAD** is a classic acronym used as a simple guideline for evaluating and prioritizing cards when building your deck in Limited formats like Sealed. It helps new players quickly sort through their card pool and decide which cards are most valuable.

The acronym stands for:  
**B**ombs → **R**emoval → **E**vasion → **A**ggro → **D**uds

### What Each Letter Means

| Letter | Category     | Explanation                                                                 | Examples in Sealed |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **B**  | Bombs       | Game-winning cards that dominate the board or win the game on their own if unanswered. Prioritize these first—build your deck around the strongest ones. | Planeswalkers, massive creatures, board wipes, powerful enchantments, or rares/mythics with overwhelming impact. |
| **R**  | Removal     | Cards that answer threats, especially opponent bombs or key creatures. Essential for controlling the game—aim for 6-8+ in your deck. | Destroy, exile, bounce, or direct damage spells; versatile answers like "kill target creature" or fight effects. |
| **E**  | Evasion     | Creatures or effects that get damage through despite blockers. Crucial for closing games against ground stalls. | Flying, menace, trample, unblockable, or creatures with reach that threaten fliers. |
| **A**  | Aggro       | Efficient, low-cost creatures that apply early pressure and curve well. Helps you win fast or force trades. | 2-drops with good stats (e.g., 2/2 or better), one-drops, or aggressive attackers that outpace opponents. |
| **D**  | Duds        | Weak or unplayable cards. Cut these ruthlessly to keep your deck at exactly 40 cards. | Overcosted creatures, narrow effects, or cards that don't fit your strategy. |

### How to Use BREAD in Sealed Deckbuilding
1. **Sort your pool** using BREAD as a filter: Pull out all Bombs first, then Removal, then Evasion creatures, then solid Aggro creatures.
2. **Identify your colors** around your top Bombs (B) and supporting Removal (R).
3. **Fill out the deck** with Evasion and Aggro pieces to support your plan.
4. **Cut everything else** (Duds) until you hit 40 cards (including 22-24 lands).

### Important Notes
- BREAD is a **starting point**, especially useful for beginners or when quickly evaluating a pool.
- It works better in older sets or formats where creatures were weaker and removal was king.
- In modern sets, the hierarchy is less strict—efficient creatures often outperform narrow removal, card advantage matters more, and synergies (tribal, mechanics) can trump raw power.
- In Sealed specifically (slower, bomb-heavy format), prioritize **B** and **R** even more than in Draft.
- Always evaluate cards in context: A "Dud" in one pool might be playable in another, and a weak "Evasion" creature might be a bomb if it fits your synergy.

### Examples from Lorwyn Eclipsed (ECL)
Lorwyn Eclipsed features tribal synergies (Merfolk, Goblins, Elves, Kithkin, Faeries, Elementals), Kindred (non-creatures count as tribes), Changelings (all types), Blight (-1/-1 counters for triggers/cost reduction), Convoke, Behold, and Vivid (multicolor triggers). Sealed favors bombs with recursion, wipes via blight, and typal payoffs in midrange archetypes like Golgari Elves (graveyard) or Rakdos Goblins (sacrifice).

| Letter | Top Examples (Name, Cost, Key Effect, Notes) |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| **B**  | - **Curious Colossus**: Shrinks all creatures to 1/1s permanently + 7/7 token (10/10 bomb, board wipe).<br>- **Soul Immolation** (X): Blight X, then X dmg to all creatures/planeswalkers/opponent (10/10 wipe).<br>- **Kinbinding** (Aura): +1/+1 per creature you control + free 1/1s (10/10 go-wide bomb).<br>- **Bloodline Bidding** (6, Convoke): Reanimate 2 creatures (8/10 recursion).<br>- **Trystan's Command** (5G Instant): Destroy + recur 2 or elf overrun (10/10 versatile). |
| **R**  | - **Sear** (1R Instant): 4 dmg to any target (6/10 efficient burn).<br>- **Blossombind** (2U): Exile creature (5/10 premium).<br>- **Grub's Command** (5G Instant): Destroy + recur from grave (9/10 3-for-1).<br>- **Ashling’s Command** (4R): One-sided Pyroclasm or token/draw (9/10 blowout).<br>- **Pyrrhic Strike**: Destroy 3+ CMC or 2 dmg + blight 2 (5/10 flexible). |
| **E**  | - **Bitterbloom Bearer** (2B Flash Faerie): ETB two 1/1 flyers, recur token (8/10 engine).<br>- **Disruptor of Currents** (3U 3/4 flying flash convoke): Tempo (8/10).<br>- **Flitterwing Nuisance** (1U 1/1 flying): Upgrades to 2/2 + draw (7/10 pressure).<br>- **Sunderflock** (6 Flash Elemental): Bounce 2 + 5/5 flyer (9/10).<br>- **Bitterblossom** (1B Saga): 1/1 flyer/turn (8/10 token stream). |
| **A**  | - **Wanderbrine Trapper** (1U 2/1): Tap opponent creature (7/10 curveout).<br>- **Unwelcome Sprite** (2B Flying Faerie): Early beater (6/10 UB aggro).<br>- **Goblin Sharpshooter** (2RR): Ping on attack/deaths (8/10 sac synergy).<br>- **Explosive Prodigy** (3R Goblin): Copy red spells (8/10 value).<br>- **Goblin Chieftain** (3RR): Haste +1/+0 lord (6/10 tribal pump). |
| **D**  | Narrow Behold effects without tribe, high-CMC no-synergy fatties (e.g., Shore Lurker 4U 3/3 flyer surveil: 2/10 vanilla), overcosted without blight payoff. |

Use BREAD to get a fast, structured overview of your pool—then refine based on your actual curve, synergies, and the format's speed. This approach helps avoid common mistakes like overvaluing mediocre creatures or ignoring removal.
