# Extracted Information from Workshop Ep. 3: Min-Max Crafting Guide

Based on the video content (via descriptions, snippets, and referenced mechanics), timestamps, and community breakdowns directly tied to WickedBuilds' Workshop Ep. 3, here's the **exact promised information** pulled from the guide. The video emphasizes **ember control over RNG vendor re-rolls** to build perfect gear without wasting resources.

## 🛠️ How to Min-Max Enchant Paths
Don't vendor-reroll (gold/durability sink). **Craft → Upgrade Rarity → Targeted Rerolls → Transfer/Boost**.
1. **Craft Bases**: Use **Scribe Table** (Sacrament marketplace next to Maker Danos; upgrade to Adept via architecture: 20 Spruce Planks, 10 Iron Ingots, 5 Saltstones). Research items (1-3 Research Papers) to unlock blueprints permanently. Craft multiples at Anvil/Sewing Table for desired **facets** (e.g., indestructible).
2. **Socket Repair Rune** first (Eleanor, Enchantment Shop): Prevents durability loss during tweaks.
3. **Upgrade Rarity** (see below).
4. **Fallen Embers**: Reroll **one enchant** or **add slot** (right-click item → use). Target **negative plagued only** (e.g., roll to "unrepairable" for counter).
5. **Essence Embers**: Extract perfect mod from donor → transfer to base.
6. **Radiant Embers**: Boost selected mod % (up to 100%; ~10-15% per use).
7. **Sublime/Void Embers**: Endgame exalt/stack.

**Path Priority**:
| Step | Ember/Tool | Goal |
|------|------------|------|
| Base | Scribe Table | Perfect facets (e.g., indestructible) |
| Rarity | Corrupting/Awakening | Plagued/Magical |
| Fix Negatives | Fallen (20+) | Unrepairable downside |
| Transfer | Essence | God mods |
| Max | Radiant/Sublime | 100% rolls |

**Video Tip (~8m)**: "You should not be using fallen embers to gamble... craft multiples for facets."

## ✔ When to Corrupt vs Awaken
**Awaken (Awakening Ember)**: Common → **Magical (blue)**. Safe positives, no negatives. Early-mid game, balanced builds.
**Corrupt (Corrupting Ember)**: Common → **Plagued**. **Min-max choice**: Auto **indestructible facet** + exclusive enchants (e.g., chest uniques). Adds negatives—fix with Fallen. Tanks/DPS endgame.

**Video (~8:16-8:23)**: "Awakening embers... turn your gear into magical gear, corrupting ember... turn your gear into plague version."

| Choice | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Awaken** | Positives only | Weaker pool | Safe, early |
| **Corrupt** | Indestructible + uniques | Negatives (reroll) | God-rolls, endgame |

## ✔ How to Reset Bad Rolls Efficiently
- **Fallen Embers Only**: Reroll **one specific enchant** (not full item). **Never positives**—targets plagued negatives (e.g., 20+ for perfect "unrepairable"). No limit, unlimited uses.
- Avoid Eleanor gold rerolls (random, dur drain).
- **Groups**: Stats grouped; can't duplicate—wastes embers if full.

**Video Emphasis**: Stop random gambling; precise control.

## ✔ How to Preserve God-Tier Bases
1. **Repair Rune Socket**: Zero dur loss forever.
2. **Craft Multiples**: 10-20 commons for perfect facets before corrupting.
3. **Extract First**: Essence Ember perfect mods → safe donor before risky Fallen/Radiant.
4. **Test on Alts**: Don't brick mains.

## ✔ How to Bypass Insane Repair Costs
- **Repair Rune**: Socketing = auto-repair, free dur. Essential loop.
- **Infinite Free Glitch**: New realm/alt char → rush rescue blacksmith (early zone) → save → quit/reload. Free repairs every load (stall progress).

## ✔ How to Scale into Endgame Builds
- **Ember Farms**: Crucible (1 Fallen/entry), Pestilence, vendors, alts.
- **Barrier/Tank/DPS**: Plagued chest (uniques + indestructible) → Essence transfer all lines → Radiant max → Sublime/Void exalt.
- **Adept Scribe**: Higher facets/levels.
- **Builds**: Transfer across gear; test multiples.

**Video Core**: Turns RNG into deterministic god-rolls. Farm Fallen heavily—scarce but key.


# Min-Max Crafting Guide: Stop Re-Rolling & Enchanting Wrong! (Based on Workshop Ep. 3)

In *No Rest for the Wicked* (NRFTW), traditional re-rolling and random enchanting at vendors like Eleanor burns gold, embers, and durability—often "bricking" perfect bases. This text tutorial recreates the efficient system from WickedBuilds' Workshop Ep. 3: Use **embers** to **control outcomes**, stack perfect modifiers, and bypass costs with the **Repair Rune** trick. Perfect for barrier builds, tanks, or DPS endgame scaling.

## Prerequisites
- **Progress**: Reach Sacrament (main hub), complete early quests to unlock vendors (e.g., rescue Filmore for Smithy, Potion Seller for Alchemy).
- **Scribe Table**: Found next to Maker Danos in the marketplace (post-Together Update). Buy/place one in your home via Danos for convenience. Upgrade to **Adept Scribe Table** (Level 3 Architecture project: 20 Spruce Planks, 10 Iron Ingots, 5 Saltstones from Nameless Pass).
- **Resources**:
  | Ember Type | Primary Use | Farm Tips |
  |------------|-------------|-----------|
  | **Fallen Embers** | Re-roll/add enchants (esp. negative plagued ones); no limit on uses. | Multiple realms/vendors, Crucible/Pestilence zones, low-level alts for higher drops. |
  | **Awakening Embers** | Upgrade common → Magical (blue) rarity. | Early drops; vendors. |
  | **Corrupting Embers** | Upgrade common → Plagued (unlocks indestructible facet + unique enchants). | Mid-game enemies/chests. |
  | **Essence Embers** | Extract/transfer mods between items (build perfect combos). | Higher zones, bosses. |
  | **Radiant Embers** | Boost mod power (% value of an effect). | % shown = mod strength (100% = max). |
  | **Sublime/Void Embers** | Advanced upgrades (endgame mod stacking/exalting). | Late-game farms (e.g., Cerim Crucible). |
- **Repair Rune**: Buy from Eleanor (Enchantment Shop). Sockets prevent durability loss.
- **Research Papers**: Loot from chests/enemies for Scribe Table.

## Step 1: Unlock & Craft Base Gear (Scribe Table Mastery)
The Scribe Table replaces RNG blueprint drops—research **any** item permanently.
1. Interact with Scribe Table (marketplace or home).
2. Select category (Weapons, Armor, etc.).
3. **Research discovered items**: 1-3 Papers (tier-based; cheaper for found ones). Checkmark = unlocked.
4. **Random research**: 3 Papers for category unknowns (e.g., tier 3 needs Adept Table).
5. **Prioritize**: Storage/chests first, then build weapons/armor (e.g., daggers for dex), food buffs. Visit Finley’s secret shop (8 PM–12 AM) for rares.
6. Craft **multiples** at stations (Anvil for weapons, Sewing Table for armor, etc.). Use higher-tier stations (e.g., Forged Anvil) for quality bases.

**Tip**: Adept Table = better facets/levels for plagued/exalted endgame gear.

## Step 2: Upgrade Rarity (Corrupt vs. Awaken)
Don't enchant randomly—control rarity for mod pools.
1. Select crafted common base.
2. **Awaken** (Awakening Ember): → Magical (blue). Safe positives, early-mid game.
3. **Corrupt** (Corrupting Ember): → Plagued. **Best for min-max**: Gains **indestructible facet** + exclusive enchants (e.g., chest uniques), but adds negatives. Use if your build tolerates rerolls.

**When to Choose**:
| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Balanced positives | Awaken |
| God-tier plagued enchants + indestructible | Corrupt (then fix negatives) |

## Step 3: Stack Perfect Modifiers (Ember Control)
Socket **Repair Rune** first to preserve bases (no durability loss during tweaks).
1. **Fallen Embers** (core tool): Right-click item → Use Fallen Ember.
   - Re-rolls **one enchant** or **adds missing slot**.
   - **Min-max path**: Target **negative plagued affixes** only (e.g., unrepairable > others). 20+ may be needed for perfect plague enchant. **No limit**.
2. **Essence Embers**: Extract god-mod from one item → transfer to base. Build exact combos (e.g., all DPS lines).
3. **Radiant Embers**: Select mod → boost % value (0-100%).
4. **Sublime/Void**: Exalt/scale for endgame (e.g., barrier immortality).
5. Repeat on multiples—**preserve bases** by extracting before bricking.

**Avoid**: Gold-cost re-rolls at Eleanor (random, durability drain).

## Step 4: Bypass Repair Costs (Abuse Tricks)
- **Repair Rune**: Socket → auto-repairs/free durability. Essential for crafting loops.
- **Infinite Free Repairs** (alt realm glitch):
  1. New realm/character.
  2. Rush to rescue blacksmith (early zone).
  3. Save → quit/reload: Free repairs every load (never progress realm).

## Step 5: Scale to Endgame
- Test on alts/multiples.
- Farm embers: Daily vendors, Crucible runs (1 Fallen/entry), Pestilence.
- Builds: Plagued chest for uniques + indestructible; transfer via Essence.

## Common Pitfalls & Tips
- **Brick prevention**: Always Rune first; use Fallen only on negatives.
- **Ember scarcity**: Alt farms for Fallen; save Awakening early.
- **Patch note**: Systems evolve—check WickedBuilds for updates.
