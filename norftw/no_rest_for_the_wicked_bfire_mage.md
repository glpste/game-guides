# Fire Mage

### Head
* 15 focus per status
* 10% fire dmg
* 20% crit dmg
* Choose
  * max health % focus 
  * regain on focus spent 

On head you want: 15 focus per status application (you apply a lot of burn status) 10% fire dmg, 20% crit dmg, and either max health increased by % of focus or regain health based on focus spent.

### Chest
* burn dmg increased by 50%
* 20% crit dmg
* any
* any 
  
Chest: burn dmg increased by 50% and 20% crit dmg.next 2 are personal preference, i picked health regen and poise while charging

### Gloves
* burn build up increase
* crit chance against burning
* any
* any

Gloves: burn build up increase, crit chance against burning. If you like parrying a lot, grab two more parry powers. If not, perhaps get gloves with the durable facet and pick healing increased by % of durability combined with 100% extra durability.

### Pants
* 20% crit dmg
* 10% fire dmg
* any
* any

Pants: 20% crit dmg, 10% fire dmg, next two are personal preference.

I wear cloth and with 17 points in equipment load I am quick. I have 50 int, 20 focus, 30 health and 20 stam. I pick crit dmg over crit chance (except on gloves) because wands and staves naturally have 40% crit chance already, but much lower crit dmg than other weapons in the game.

### Weapons
Weapons I use molten clutch fire wand for its amazing moveset with a shield that gives dmg increased after parry (plagued shield with block disabled). For its runes I have inferno, armageddon, a plague generator spell, and the amazing lightning rune Shock Strike (dash in, do lightning slam that explodes because the enemy is burning, dash out before explosion hits. I kitted my wand out with more attack speed because I love it. Whomever designed the Molten Clutch's moveset should get a raise.

Then the staff. I use Frigid Winter. A frost staff. I even kept the first two runes that naturally come with it because if you kill those leech monstrosities with the frost beam, they dont explode in little leeches. The first rune I barely use, but when I do it freezes bosses. On this staff you roll the stat 20% increased Rune Dmg, and you put the fireball generator rune on. This fireball will do a lot of damage fully charged.

I hope this helped and it gave you some ideas! I have a lot of fun with this load out. It can do almost anything.
